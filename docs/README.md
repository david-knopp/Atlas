## What is it?
Atlas is a library of handy, reusable classes and methods created with the intention to make day-to-day development in Unity easier, more intuitive, and less repetitive.

It's not meant to provide groundbreaking solutions to specific problems, but rather provide a practical set of tools that let you create those solutions quicker and more efficiently.

## Installation
###### 1. Import the Unity Package (recommended)
Download the latest .unitypackage from the [releases page](https://github.com/david-knopp/Atlas/releases "releases page"). Then, simply drag and drop the [package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html "package") into your Unity project.  

In an effort to keep your project tidy, Atlas will place itself in `Assets/ThirdParty/Atlas/`.
###### 2. Copy/paste the source folders
Download or clone the latest master branch, then copy the assets contained at `Assets/Scripts/` of the Atlas project into your Unity project.

###### 3. Mix & Match
Many of the files/classes contained within Atlas can be used on their own without any other dependencies. Therefore, individual files can be copied from the repository for use within your Unity projects.
