## What is it?
Atlas is a library of handy, reusable classes and methods created with the intention to make day-to-day development in Unity easier, more intuitive, and less repetitive.

It's not meant to provide groundbreaking solutions to specific problems, but rather provide a practical set of tools that let you create those solutions quicker and more efficiently.

## Installation
Download the latest .unitypackage from the [releases page](https://github.com/david-knopp/Atlas/releases "releases page"). To include Atlas in your project, simply drag and drop the [package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html "package") into your Unity project. 

In an effort to keep your project tidy, Atlas will place itself in `Assets/ThirdParty/Atlas/`.
